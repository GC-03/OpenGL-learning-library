# OpenGL-learning-library

This is a library containing programs I'm making while learning OpenGL.
My study source is https://learnopengl.com/. My programs follow the same structure, but I added some experiments I made on my own.
Library used:
	- GLFW3: used to manage windows and OpenGL contexts
	- GLAD: used to get OpenGL headers

# Compilation and execution

This repo is mainly for archiving purposes, but it is possible to compile and run any program in it.
To do so, follow these steps:

	1 - Open the solution in Visual Studio
	2 - Uncomment the desired source code file (or all the source code files in a sub-directory, depending on the case)
	3 - Compile and run
